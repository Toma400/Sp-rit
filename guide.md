# WELCOME TO SPIRIT!

### WHAT IS SPIRIT?

Sp>rit (or *Spirit*) is small, simple esoteric language with basic functionalities. 

**Sp>rit** was designed as learning ground for me, since it is my first programming language and I have already plans for some more advanced ones in the future - but it'd be quite foolish to start from sophisticated concepts as first project, right?

I couldn't resist making it fun project for me, though.

Therefore, it is purposedly made as a challenge for coders using it, following several principles making it get rid of some common functionalities (which can, though, be restored with more verbose Sp>rit handling - more on that later in guide).

**What the name stands for?** Well, it is small reference to my later project - language called *Tribal*, and IDE for it being *Ritual*. I just really like such names.
After discovering [this project though](https://github.com/issadarkthing/spirit), I changed its name from *Spirit* to *Sp>rit* (pronounced the same way). It kinda fits the name better, because:
- it conveys nicely the basic syntax of Sp>rit
- it conveys *perfectly* transition from `.sp` (Spirit extension) to `.rit` (Tribal extension) - I didn't make that by purpose, which is truly amazing
- it doesn't fill up quite amazing name for such poor language (albeit fun one during writing, in my personal opinion)

### RULES OF SP>RIT

To use Spirit, you need to write inside file with either `.sp` or `.sr` extension - both are considered valid.

After that, you are ready to write your program. Sp>rit operates on those rules:
- Everything is a **variable**. The only time you will not refer to variable directly is inside conditions (this exception is made only to limit your suffering).
- Code goes **from top to bottom**, you cannot "jump" with code, since there are no functions. The only time this has an exception is within *for* loop.
- There's **no return** possibility for anything - you can reference variables, but you cannot pass returns in any way. Since there's no functions, it wouldn't make sense anyway.
