# NuBasic

NuBasic is language following [tutorial of CodePulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg)
and as such, it is no different from it, it will be copy-pasted code basically.

It is put into GitHub because it allows me to further experiment with stuff, without me
losing currently made progress. It will be small project leading eventually to `Sp>rit`
language, so NuBasic files will be put on Sp>rit branch because of that.

You can use this language if you want, even though I have no idea why you would need it.
